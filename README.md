# Implementation of Multi-Agent Exploitation Models with Social Learning

Based on the copan:EXPLOIT model, aiming to develop more complex learning processes. 
The original Python/Cython implementation can be found here: <https://github.com/wbarfuss/cyexploit>.

## Requirements 
[Torch](https://pytorch.org/) (for model NV2 only).

## Model Description

The NV2 model implementation is inspired by those of [CleanRL](https://docs.cleanrl.dev/): [ppo_continuous_action](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/blob/master/cleanrl/ppo_continuous_action.py) and [ppo_atari_lstm](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/blob/master/cleanrl/ppo_atari_lstm.py).
